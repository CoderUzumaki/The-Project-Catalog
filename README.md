## 🛠️ Challenges We Overcame

- **Building a Community from Scratch**  
  We had to solve the "chicken-and-egg" problem: no projects without a community, and no community without projects. To kickstart DevHub, we became our own first users—seeding the platform with dozens of curated ideas and building initial projects.

- **Designing a Meaningful Point System**  
  Balancing the points economy was tricky. Points needed to be an achievement, but not too hard to earn. We worked on tuning the system so it encourages participation without feeling unreachable.
